# BFS and DFS Implementations in Java

This project contains Java implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.

## Features
- BFS Implementation
- DFS Implementation
- Example usage of both algorithms

## Technologies Used
- Java

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/javaProjects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `bfsAndDfs` directory:
    ```sh
    cd javaProjects/bfsAndDfs
    ```
3. Compile the Java files:
    ```sh
    javac *.java
    ```
4. Run the example:
    ```sh
    java Main
    ```

## Usage
- The `BFS.java` file contains the implementation of the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- The `DFS.java` file contains the implementation of the Depth-First Search algorithm.
