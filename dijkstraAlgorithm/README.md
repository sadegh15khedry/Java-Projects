# Dijkstra Algorithm

## Overview

The Dijkstra Algorithm project is an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. This project demonstrates how to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which is useful in various applications such as network routing, mapping, and pathfinding in games. The project provides a clear and efficient implementation of the algorithm in Java.

## Technologies Used

- Java

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/dijkstraAlgorithm.git
   cd dijkstraAlgorithm
   ```

### Build and Run

2. **Build and run the application:**
   - Compile the Java source files.
   ```
   javac DijkstraAlgorithm.java
   ```
   - Run the program:
   ```
   java DijkstraAlgorithm
   ```


## Known Issues

- The current implementation does not support user input for the graph.
- The program does not currently run successfully and does not produce an output.
- The current implementation may not handle very large graphs efficiently.

## Future Plans

- **Fix Runtime Issues**: Debug and fix the current issues preventing the program from running and producing an output.
- **Enhanced Input Handling**: Add support for user input to define the graph.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the algorithm for better performance with large graphs.
- **Extended Features**: Add support for additional graph algorithms and functionalities.
