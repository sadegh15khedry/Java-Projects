# Compilers Scanner and Parser

## Overview

The Compilers Scanner and Parser project is an implementation of a lexical analyzer (scanner) and a syntax analyzer (parser) for a simple programming language. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of compiler design, including tokenization and parsing of source code. The project is implemented in Java.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenize the input source code into a series of tokens.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Parse the series of tokens to ensure the code adheres to the grammar rules of the language.
- **Error Detection**: Identify and report lexical and syntax errors in the source code.

## Technologies Used

- Java

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/compilersScannerAndParser.git
   cd compilersScannerAndParser
   ```

### Build and Run

2. **Build and run the application:**
   - Compile the Java source files.
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
   - Run the program:
   ```
   java Main
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input Source Code**: Provide the source code to be analyzed either through a text file or directly in the console.
2. **Run Analysis**: Execute the program to perform lexical and syntax analysis on the provided source code.
3. **Review Output**: Review the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and the parsing results.

## Known Issues

- The current implementation may not handle all edge cases in the source code.
- Error messages may not be detailed enough to easily identify the source of issues.

## Future Plans

- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhance error messages to provide more detailed information about the source of lexical and syntax errors.
- **Extended Language Support**: Extend the implementation to support more complex language constructs and grammar rules.
- **Optimization**: Optimize the performance of the lexical and syntax analysis processes.
